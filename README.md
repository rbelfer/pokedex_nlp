# Predicting Pokemon type using Natural Language Processing!

Please refer to the Python Notebook file for all of the code used for the project.

Separation of the code by purpose TBD.

The files for the models are too large to host on GitHub, if you'd like to have the model, feel free to save your own. The results may be slightly different when you test with original data.
